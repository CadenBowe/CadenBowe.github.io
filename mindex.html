            <h2>Basic Motorcycle Knowlege</h2>
            <p>Motorcycles are two-wheeled vehicles that are popular for their efficiency, speed, and agility. They are used for a variety of purposes, including commuting, touring, racing, and off-road adventures. Motorcycles come in different types such as cruisers, sport bikes, touring bikes, dirt bikes, and scooters, each designed to cater to specific riding needs.</p>
            <p>Invented in the late 19th century, motorcycles have evolved significantly, becoming more powerful and technologically advanced. Today, they feature innovations like anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control, and even electric powertrains.</p>
